# Hippy Mood - vue2fromscratch branch
After troubles to migrate Hippymood directly to the version 2 of vuejs, I will be following a complete vue2 tutorial from scratch and integrate the result to Hippymood.

The goals : 
- Become familiar with vue2
- Clean the architecture by splitting the UI in multiple components
- Check if components might help to move to a modular architecture and allow different behaviours on different instances but keeping the same core.

## Usage
node httpServer.js
Open your browser to localhost:3000 and start hacking.

## Tutorial
I will follow this video tutorial about vuejs (french) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7YKecZhFRA&list=PLjwdMgw5TTLW-mAtlR46VajrKs4dep3y0&index=1
